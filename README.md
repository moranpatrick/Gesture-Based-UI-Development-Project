# Introduction<a name = "intro"></a>
This repository contains a solution to our Fourth Year, Gesture Based UI and Development Project.

### Project Spec
<img src="images/spec.png">

For our project we have decided to use a [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) along with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) to develop a simple 3d, ball and maze game.

### Myo Armband

The Myo armband, manufactured by [Thalmic Labs](https://www.thalmic.com/), is a wearable gesture control and motion control device that lets you take control of your phone, computer, and so much more, touch-free. It allows the user to wirelessly control control these devices using various hand motion and gestures.


### Unity

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by [Unity Technologies](https://unity3d.com/), which is primarily used to develop both three-dimensional and two-dimensional video games and simulations for computers, consoles,and mobile devices.
